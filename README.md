# Bounce

This is a Android mobile game which was coded entirely in Java with Android Studio. The basic function of the game is a classic "tap to fly" element, which makes the main character jump upon tapping the screen. The aim of the game is to make the main character jump to fall between a gate (which is worth one point). To keep your character from leaving the screen, which ends the game, you must make the character hit either stick on the sides of the screen. These sticks get progressively shorter as the game continues, and even begin to move as you obtain more points. Upon losing, your score for that particular round, as well as your all time high score are then displayed. You then have the option to replay the game. Every couple rounds, the user might see either a banner ad (located at the top or bottom of the screen), or an intersitial ad before the game restarts. This game is available to download on the Google Play Store for Android devices at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fishbowl.appone.bounce&fbclid=PAAaby3xm40MgJf57tC9JNu1MyFijeO3zoNh5N0YHtrgFYJsB28SSb4xecrFo&pli=1
